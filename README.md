## ✅ Things I Learned
	- Containerized and deployed Flask apps using Docker and integrated Jenkins CI/CD on AWS EC2.
	- Provisioned HA AWS infrastructure with Terraform, Jenkins pipelines, and remote state handling.
	- Built and deployed 10-tier microservices on EKS using Helm, Ingress, and ECR.
	- Set up Kubernetes monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Slack alerts using Helm.
	
## ⚠️ Problems I Encountered
	- Docker image and port mismatch caused app failures and build errors from missing files.
	- Jenkins setup had Java issues, Docker permissions, and plugin auto-setup gaps.
	- Terraform state lock conflicts and incorrect subnet or AMI selection affected automation.
	- Kubernetes DNS issues, Ingress misconfig, and Helm chart errors disrupted service exposure.

## 💡 My Takeaways
	- Always validate network configs, port mappings, and environment variables early.
	- Script installations and IAM roles for repeatable infra provisioning and secure pipelines.
	- Use Helm values, annotations, and standardized manifests to streamline Kubernetes ops.
	- Cloud platform IAM (AWS/GCP) must be planned carefully for least privilege and CI/CD flow.
